## STAAD.Pro G+2 Steel Residential Building – Structural + Vastu Design

This project involves the structural analysis and design of a G+2 steel-frame residential building on a 12 m × 15 m footprint (X-Z axis), modeled in STAAD.Pro with height in the Y-axis. The structure is subjected solely to self-weight, designed using IS 800:2007 (WSD) standards. The core objective is to ensure structural safety while embracing functional and cultural design logic derived from Indian household planning traditions.

### Objective

To model, analyze, and optimize a G+2 residential structure using ISMB and ISSC steel sections, under dead load only. The design goal is to maintain safety and serviceability using standard Indian steel profiles with minimal redundancy and without extra columns in upper floors.

### Structural Details

- **Sections Used**: ISMB 125/200, ISSC 200/250, ISWB 350, ISHB 400  
- **Support Conditions**: Fixed support at all base columns  
- **Critical Conditions Considered**: Slenderness under compression/tension, moment amplification  
- **Failed Members Addressed**: Members M46, M51, M57, M58, M60, etc. were optimized or resized  

### Planning Philosophy

This layout follows traditional Hindu home planning:
- Central **hall** with extended space for guests and family movie time  
- Side-by-side **kitchen and meal table**, positioned to allow visibility to the hall TV  
- Spacious **bedrooms** for parents and children with **attached bathrooms**  
- **Indoor-outdoor bathroom access**, improving utility during gatherings or gardening  
- **Dedicated garden** space beside the house  
- **Car parking space** integrated in plinth without additional columns  
- **Staircase positioned on the side**, preserving the aesthetic of the front face  
- All spaces designed for **ease of accessibility**, functionality, and cultural alignment  

### Result & Conclusion

- Most members passed the IS 800 code check
- Failed members were improved through section substitution
- Final structure is optimized for dead load, with clean vertical load transfer  
- Design satisfies both engineering strength and traditional usability requirements  

### What I Learned

- How to use STAAD.Pro to model complex multi-storey structures  
- Importance of proper member assignment, unsupported lengths, and buckling checks  
- Integrating architectural planning with structural logic  
- How Indian planning principles (Vastu + practicality) can co-exist with modern design

This model is an academic demonstration of how civil engineering tools can be aligned with real-world housing requirements, offering both strength and soul.
